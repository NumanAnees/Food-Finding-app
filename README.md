# TopDish


## Problem : 

As a food lover i know that it is a big problem to find reviews about specific food/dish. Food lovers have to try many food points to find the best taste and due to this some food points with good food quality but less social media presence remain hidden. In Google maps, people can give stars only; they can not mention that these 5‚≠ê are about which dish specifically. It is possible that a restaurant has 4.5 ratings on Google Maps, but some of their dishes are not worth eating.

## Solution :

On my website you can upvote or downvote any food point after selecting a specific category. You can also add a new location if it is not present in the list. Food points with more number of upvotes remain on top. So, next time you do not have to search in any food related groups like ESR(eat sleep & repeat) etc you can easily find which restaurant has best shuwarma or pizza in town.  
I'm currently working on it to add some more features like sorting on the basis of price or ambiance etc.

## Scope of this Project

In future we can extend it to a fully functional startup. We can add cities or even countries. We can link it to any delivery app like food panda or byte or can start our own. We can give discount offers and can also do paid promotions by reserving the first position for the paid food points only.
